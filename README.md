### How to Use
1. Install the required libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).
2. Load your dataset into the notebook.
3. Run the code snippets in the notebook sequentially, adapting them to your specific dataset and requirements.
4. Customize the code snippets as needed (e.g., adjusting parameters, modifying visualization styles, incorporating domain-specific knowledge).
5. Observe the output, perform data cleaning, analyze the data using EDA techniques, build classification models, and evaluate their performance.
Please note that this notebook serves as a reference and starting point for data cleaning, EDA, and classification tasks. You may need to modify or extend the code depending on your specific dataset, feature engineering requirements, and modeling techniques.

By incorporating this comprehensive Classification codebase, you can expedite your model building and analysis, allowing you to focus on deriving valuable insights from your machine learning projects. Happy coding!
